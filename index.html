                    hello, i'm catherine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i was raised in deep south Texas for the majority of my life. after i locked in my choice to attend university in Houston, i discovered a huge love for the city, and a new permanent home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i'm currently a graphic designer, after graduating with a degree in media production, and i'm looking for opportunities to grow and be challenged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    in my spare time i enjoy socialization with friends and family, video games, and arts and crafts, especially painting.
